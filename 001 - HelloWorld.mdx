# First Java Program

## Installation

Download the JDK from  [oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) website for your operating system and install it

## Creating file

Create a file and name it `Main.java`, 
add the following code in this file and save it


```java
public class Main {
        public static void main (String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]  
>  You can also name the file something else with .java extension but the begining class name must match as the file name 
> ie: if the filename is `Demo.java` then first line of code should be:
>  ```java
>  public class Demo
> ```

## Code Explanation

- Line 1: any code runs in java must be inside a class in order to run to above we used `Main`
- Line 2: we defined `main()` method, only the code inside the main method will be executed 
- Line 3: `System.out.println()` println is a method to print some value as output which require System class and its member out, anything we write inside
it

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Remember to add a semicolon '`;`' at the end of each statement

## Running code

Open the terminal and navigate to the folder in which you've saved the file and run the following commands"

```bash
javac Main.java
```

this will compile your code 

```bash
java Main
```
This will run the file and output will be:

Now for all program, running the code is same as this
