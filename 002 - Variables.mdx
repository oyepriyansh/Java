# Variables in Java
Variables are data containers which are used to store the data values during program execution

## Creating/Declaring Variables

### Syntax 
```java
int Num = 45;
```

where `int` is a data type, `Num` is a variable name and `45` is the value of the variable `Num`

### Example
```java
public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		int Num = 45;
		System.out.println(Num);
	}
}

```
> The output of the above code will be 45

---

Changing a variable value
```java
int Num = 45;
Num = 54;
```
> Now the value of `Num` variable will be updated to 54

---

You can also create a variable and assign a value to it later

### Example 
```java
int Num;
Num = 45;
```
