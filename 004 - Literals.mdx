# Literals

Literals are the fixed values used in the source code, they can be assigned to a variable or used in expressions.


```java
int Score = 5;
```
> here 5 is the decimal integral literal

```java
int Score = 0b101;
```
> here 0b101 = 5, this is a binary integral literal where 0b says its binary and 101 is the binary value of 5, so the value of Score variable will be 5

example of a hexadecimal literal 

```java
int Score = 0x7E;
```
> here 0x7E; this is a hexadecimal integral literal where 0x says its hexadecimal and 7E is hexadecimal value of 126, so value of Score variale will be 126


So all values are literals and the type of them is their data type 

for example 

```java
String str = "Priyansh";
```

the data type of variable `str` is String, and its value is Priyansh, so Priyansh is a String literal
