# Casting 

Casting in java allows to convert a variable to one type to another

> [!NOTE]
> casting doesn't work with `boolen` data type

## Widening Casting

this happens automatically when converting a small data type to a larger data type, like `byte` to `int`

byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

### Syntax example of widening casting
```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
  byte a = 120;
  int b = a;
  System.out.println(b);
}
}
```

## Narrowing Casting
this has to be done manually by the converting data type next to the value when converting a larger data type to small data type, like `double` to `float`

double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

### syntax example of narrow casting 
```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
  double a = 9.11;
  float c = (float) a;
  System.out.println(c);
  }
}
```

> [!CAUTION]
> in some cases of casting you will loose some part of values

> eg: assigning a variable with `float` data type with a value of 5.6 and later if we convert it into `int` and print the value, then it will give 5 as a output not 5.6, therefore .6 will be loose

> ```java
> public class Main {
>   public static void main(String args[]) {
>   int a = 296;
>   byte c = (byte) a;
>   System.out.println(c);
>   }
> }
> ```

> > here the output will be 40
> as bytes only supports value from -128 to 127, so there is no way the output will be 296 as defind in the above code, the modulas of value with its range (ie: 296 % 256)
> same for all narrow
