# if

used to execute the code block if a condition is true 

example

```java
if (50 > 25) {
  System.out.println(50 is greater than 25):
 }
```

as the condition 50 > 25 is true so the code block `System.out.println(50 is greater than 25):` will be executed, if we change it to something false then the code block will not be execited

```java
if (25 = 50) {
  // anything written here will not be exeuted as the condition is false
}
```

# else
code block inside `else` will be executed when the condition inside `if` is false

```java
if (false) {
  System.out.println("Hi"); // this will not execute
}
else {
  System.out.println("The condition is false); // this code block will execute
}
```

# else if 

this is used to specify a new condition if the first condition is `false`

```java
if (false) {
  System.out.println("something"); // this will not executed 
}
else if (true) {
  System.out.println("Condition 2nd is true");
}
```

### example

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    if (1 > 2) {
      System.out.println("1 is greater than 2");
    }
    else if (3 > 2) {
      System.out.println("3 is greater than 2");
    }
    else {
      System.out.println("2 is greatest of all time");
    }
  }
}
```
> Output: **3 is greater than 2**
>
> as the 2nd condition `3 > 2` is true
